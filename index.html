        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-4 col-sm-12">Year Zero is the fifth studio album by American industrial rock act
            Nine
            Inch Nails (pictured), released on April 17,
            2007, by Interscope Records. Frontman Trent Reznor wrote the music and lyrics while touring for the group's
            previous
            release, With Teeth (2005). Contrasting Reznor's previously introverted style of songwriting, Year Zero is a
            concept
            album that criticizes contemporary policies of the U.S. government by presenting a dystopian vision of the
            year 2022. It
            is part of a project which includes a remix album and an alternate reality game (ARG). The Year Zero ARG
            expanded upon
            the album's fictional storyline by using media such as websites, pre-recorded phone messages, and murals.
            Year Zero
            received very positive reviews, many favorable toward the ARG. The album produced two singles, "Survivalism"
            and
            "Capital G", the latter released as a promotional single. Disputes arose between Reznor and Universal Music
            Group,
            parent company of Interscope, over the overseas pricing of the album. (Full article...)</div>

            In a 2005 interview with Kerrang!, Trent Reznor raised his intentions to write material for a new release
            while on tour
            promoting With Teeth. He reportedly began work on the new album by September 2006.[2] Reznor devised much of
            the album's
            musical direction on his laptop.[3] Reznor told Kerrang! in a later interview, "When I was on the Live: With
            Teeth tour,
            to keep myself busy I just really hunkered down and was working on music the whole time, so this kept me in
            a creative
            mode and when I finished the tour I felt like I wasn't tired and wanted to keep at it."[4]

            The limitations of devising the album's musical direction on a tour bus forced Reznor to work differently
            from usual.
            Reznor said, "I didn't have guitars around because it was too much hassle ... It was another creative
            limitation ... If
            I were in my studio, I would have done things the way I normally do them. But not having the ability to do
            that forced
            me into trying some things that were fun to do."[5]

            By the end of the tour, Reznor began work on the album's lyrical concepts, attempting to break away from his
            typically
            introspective approach. Reznor drew inspiration from his concern at the state of affairs in the United
            States and at
            what he envisioned as the country's political, spiritual, and social direction.[6] Year Zero was mixed in
            January
            2007,[7] and Reznor stated on his blog that the album was finished as of February 5.[8] The album's budget
            was a
            reported US$2 million, but since Reznor composed most of the album himself on his laptop and in his
            home-studio, much of
            the budget instead went toward the extensive accompanying promotional campaign.[5]

            A song cut from the album included vocal work by Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme. The same year, Reznor
            contributed
            vocals to their song "Era Vulgaris", which was also cut from the album of the same name.[9]
